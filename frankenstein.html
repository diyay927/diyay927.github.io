            He easily eluded me and said—
            <br /><br />
            ‘Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent
            to your hatred on my devoted head.
            Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? <b>
            Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me,
            and I will defend it.</b>
            <br /><br />
            Remember, thou hast made me more
            powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
            joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself
            in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even
            mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt
            also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein,
            be not equitable to every other and trample upon
            me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and
            affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;
            I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel,
            whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.
            Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was
            benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me
            happy, and I shall again be virtuous.’
            <br /><br />
            ‘Begone! I will not hear you.
            There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.
            Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.’
            <br /><br />
           ‘How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to
            turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy
            goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was
            benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but
            am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me;
            what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me
            nothing?'
