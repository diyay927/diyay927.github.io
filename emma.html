          “No,”—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he
          still spoke—“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not
          gone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added—“I stopped you
          ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you
          pain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to
          ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a
          friend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like. I
          will tell you exactly what I think.”
          <br /><br />
          “As a friend!”—repeated Mr. Knightley.—“Emma, that I fear is a word—No,
          I have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far
          already for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it
          may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me,
          then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”
          <br /><br />
          He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression
          of his eyes overpowered her.
          <br /><br />
          “My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever
          the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved
          Emma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be said.”—She could really
          say nothing.—“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;
          “absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”
          <br /><br />
          Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The
          dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most
          prominent feeling.
          <br /><br />
          <b>“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of such
          sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably
          convincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it
          more. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.</b>—I
          have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other
          woman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell
          you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner,
          perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a
          very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you
          understand my feelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I
          ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”
