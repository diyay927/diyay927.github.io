          He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he
          went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his
          majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the
          armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or
          misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there
          was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see
          why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world
          outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her
          and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.
          <br /><br />
          <b>For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids
          and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of
          the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new
          tunes.</b> All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the
          “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver
          slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were
          always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,
          while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the
          sad horns around the floor.
          <br /><br />
          Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the
          season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with
          half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and
          chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor
          beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a
          decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision
          must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable
          practicality—that was close at hand.
          <br /><br />
          That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom
          Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his
          position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain
          struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was
          still at Oxford.
